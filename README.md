# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Unicorn Companies

This repository contains the code and documentation for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Unicorn Companies' dataset using Python. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process that helps us understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data.

## Dataset

The dataset provided by Unicorn Companies is stored in file named `UnicornCompanies.csv`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the EDA process, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries and dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `UnicornData_EDA.ipynb` to access the EDA code and analysis.

## EDA Process

The EDA process for the Unicron Companies dataset involves the following steps:

1. Importing the necessary libraries and modules, such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.pyplot.
2. Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and displaying the first few rows to understand the data structure.
3. Checking for duplicates in the data to ensure data integrity.
4. Examining the data types of the columns to understand the nature of the data.
5. Handling missing values and outliers, if any, to ensure data quality.
6. Visualizing the data using various plots and charts to gain insights and identify patterns.
7. Performing statistical analysis to summarize the data and extract meaningful information.
8. Exploring the relationships between different variables and identifying correlations.
9. Making data-driven recommendations and insights based on the findings from the EDA.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── UnicornCompanies.csv.csv # Dataset file
├── UnicornData_EDA.ipynb    # Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and analysis
├── README.md                # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt         # Required Python libraries and dependencies
```

## Results and Findings

The results and findings of the EDA process will be documented in the Jupyter Notebook `UnicornData_EDA.ipynb`. The notebook will include visualizations, statistical analysis, and insights gained from exploring the Unicorn Companies dataset.
